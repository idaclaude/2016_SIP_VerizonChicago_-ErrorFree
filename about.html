LaDybugger makes coding in Python more accessible to beginning and intermediate programmers. Rather than receiving intimidating and incomprehensible syntax errors from the console when you make a mistake, our website translates these errors into plain English. While websites like <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com" target="_blank"> CodeAcademy</a> also provide interactive feedback when you code, our website allows users to code freely and independently until guidance is needed. <br>The hardest technical problem we faced while coding this website was figuring out how to code Python in the browser rather than using an offline word processor. However, we modified and improved a basic version of the <a href="http://www.skulpt.org/" target="_blank">Skulpt</a> code which allowed us to put a console in our website. We used HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, CSS, and Python to create our web application. We hope LaDybugger helps you debug your code!
